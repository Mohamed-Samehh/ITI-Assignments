2- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) uses static module loading, allowing the structure of imports and exports to be determined at compile time, enabling better optimization and tooling. In contrast, CommonJS (CJS) uses dynamic loading, where modules are loaded at runtime, which limits static analysis and optimization. Node.js prefers ESM for its standardization and future compatibility.

3- Circular dependency happens when two or more modules depend on each other directly or indirectly. This can cause errors or unexpected behavior because modules may not be fully loaded when required.
